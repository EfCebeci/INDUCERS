# INDUCERS
> An AI lab to decipher lost languages. (YC W26)

INDUCERS is a 'Hard Tech' AI research lab on a mission to decipher lost languages. We are starting with the Indus script—a 50-year-old academic problem.

This repository contains the core Python data pipeline and our initial experimental results that serve as **Proof of Execution** for our YC W26 application.

## The 50-Year-Old Problem
For 50 years, academic analysis of the Indus script has been stuck on traditional frequency counts (N-Grams) of the symbols themselves. This is a "flat data" approach that has failed to yield conclusive results.

## Our Solution: The 'Hard Tech' Hack
We believe this is not just a linguistic problem; it is a **computational, large-scale data engineering problem.**

Our hypothesis is that the key to decipherment is hidden not in the *frequency* of symbols, but in their **structural and syntactic relationships**.

The academic community has already tagged linguistic data (e.g., the `.conll` format) with this rich structural information (like `deprel` and `upos` fields), but they lack the computational tools to leverage its full potential.

Our models (GNNs and Transformers) are the first to analyze this deep grammatical structure, moving from "what symbol is next?" to "why is this symbol the *subject* of that symbol?".

## Our Model: Open-Core
INDUCERS is a **for-profit company** that funds an **open-source mission**.

* **Our Product:** We sell paid API access to our unified analysis platform, allowing researchers and universities to analyze *all* ancient languages (solved and unsolved).
* **Our Mission (Open-Source):** We use this revenue to fund our core research mission: the open-source decipherment of lost languages like the Indus script.

## Current Status & Proof (This Repo)
This repository is the live proof of our methodology.

1.  **Data Pipeline (`src/analysis/stats.py`):** This is our core Python script. It parses the complex, tagged `.conll` corpus (which we reverse-engineered) and uses libraries like `pandas` and `scikit-learn` to perform structural analysis.
2.  **Experimental Proof (`reports/`):** This folder contains the `.csv` files generated by our pipeline. These reports (e.g., `01_upos_frequency.csv`, `03_deprel_frequency.csv`) are our experimental proof that these rich, structural patterns exist and are quantifiable.

## Our 3-Stage Roadmap
* **Stage 1 (Nov 2025): The Semantic Bridge.** We will finalize the `indus_to_tamil_map.json` to link unsolved Indus signs to the rich grammatical structure of the Tamil (Dravidian) corpus.
* **Stage 2 (YC Batch): The Core AI Model.** We will build our first GNN/Transformer models to analyze the Indus script's underlying structure, using the (approx. $125k) YC funding for GPU compute.
* **Stage 3 (Day 120): The API Beta Launch.** We will launch the initial usable beta of our API platform to our first university design partners.
